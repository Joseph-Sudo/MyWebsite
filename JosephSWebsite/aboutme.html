	Hello everyone. My name is Joseph Sangurima and I'm an animation student.
    <br>My favorite things to do are drawing, listening to music, browsing around the internet and playing videogames.
    <br>What inspired me to follow animation is kind of hard to say. I know that ever since I was little I loved watching cartoons, but that was the extent of it. Usually I would be obsessing over the latest Spider-Man movie or playing video games. It could stem from there though since most of what I saw had to deal with the extraordinary, and animation does offer limitless possibilities in terms of what you can do.
    <br> Some of my biggest influences are from 2D animation, most seen in a majority of cartoons, superhero comics, and anime. Just the way the animators makes the characters move and react is something breathtaking and brings a feeling of realism that, quite ironically, real life can't imitate.
    <br>Well, that's  everything I have so far. To compensate, here is a picture of me, and a doodle of me side to side.
