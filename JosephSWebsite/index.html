    Hello everybody. My name is Joseph Sangurima. I'm an animation student attending BMCC (Borough of Manhattan Community College) in order to hone my art and become an animator. In this page I'm gonna give you updates on what's been happing recently, whether it be project status, personal issues or even some of my general opinions. You may have noticed the three little links that are at the top of the page. Each one leads to a different page about me.
    </p>
    <p> About leads to information, well, about me, like my general being, my likes and dislikes and some inspirations.
    </p>
    <p> Gallery leads to my art gallery, where you can see some of the drawings and animations that I've made.
    </p>
    <p> Contacts leads to my where you can find me on, such as Facebook an Twitter, or know where to contact me, such as email.
    </p>
